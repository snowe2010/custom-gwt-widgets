This is a collection of widgets which simplify the testing of GXT web applications by extending the page-object gem.

The goal of this library is two-fold.  One, to provide a useful set of widgets for working with standard GXT controls.  Second, to provide examples of how to extend PageObject for interacting with complex controls.

The first widgets are gxt_grid and gxt_pager.
